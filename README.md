# Carlifornia Predictions

I have been practising Data Science and machine learning with "Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit learn and Tensor flow", tackling most of the exercises and practice examples and feel confident on sharing some of my notebooks.
Am really excited about this and will love all the contributions and comments to help me become better, am also open to collaborate for kaggle competitions.
